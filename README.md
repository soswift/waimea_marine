# Analysis Of Microbiomes And Metabolomes Of Dominant Coral Reef Primary Producers

This repository contains the data and code for the analyses included in the manuscript "Microbiomes and metabolomes of dominant coral reef primary producers illustrate a potential role for immunolipids in marine symbioses"

The code is separated into scripts, which are lossely grouped based on the level of analysis and the desired output.  
The scripts are meant to be run sequentially starting with "1_Clean_Data.R". However, processed data files are present in the data directory and should allow any script to be run at any time.

data/ = raw and processed data files
output/ = plots and statistical outputs from the code
src/ = functions used in some the analyses
